Question 3:

String Data type:
	It is used to represent Textual Data. They are created using single or double quotes surrounding 
one or more character.

ex: var a='hi!'; //using single quotes
    var b="hello"; //using double quotes

Number Data type:
	The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place,
 or numbers written using exponential notation e.g. 2.1e-3 

It includes some specialvalues which are Infinity, -Infinity and NaN(Not-a-Number).

ex: var a = 77;       //Integer
    var b = 22.5;     //floating point number
    var c = 4.25e+6;  // exponential notation, same as 4.25e6 or 4250000
    var d = 4.25e-6;  // exponential notation, same as 0.00000425

    alert(16 / 0);  // Output: Infinity
    alert(-16 / 0); // Output: -Infinity
    alert(16 / -0); // Output: -Infinity
   
    alert("Some text" / 2);       // Output: NaN
    alert("Some text" / 2 + 10);  // Output: NaN

Boolean Data type:
	The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like 
yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false), etc.

Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons in a program.

ex: var isReading = true;   // yes, I'm reading
var isSleeping = false; // no, I'm not sleeping

var a = 2, b = 5, c = 10;
 
alert(b > a) // Output: true
alert(b > c) // Output: false

Undefined Data Type:
	The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has 
been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.

ex: var a;
    var b = "Hello World!"
 
    alert(a) // Output: undefined
    alert(b) // Output: Hello World!

Null Data Type:
	This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that
 there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.

ex: var a = null;
    alert(a); // Output: null

Object Data Type:
	The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.

ex: var emptyObject = {};
    var person = {"name": "Clark", "surname": "Kent", "age": "36"};

Array Data Type:
	An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable.

ex: var colors = ["Red", "Yellow", "Green", "Orange"];
    var cities = ["London", "Paris", "New York"];
 
    alert(colors[0]);   // Output: Red
    alert(cities[2]);   // Output: New York
